"""Live-path MDBList micro-batcher.

A Stremio catalog page asks for 20–100 posters at once, and every one whose
rating isn't cached used to cost its own MDBList request.  Requests for the
same ``(provider, type, key)`` that arrive within ``window`` seconds of the
first (or until ``max_ids`` are waiting) share one bulk POST instead
(ratings.fetch_ratings_bulk).  The key is part of the group, so a client's own
``mdblist_key`` is only ever batched with requests made on that same key —
never with the server key's, nor anyone else's.

A batch of one goes by the single call: the same one request, and it still
carries keywords.  When the bulk call fails in a way that turned bulk off, the
titles it didn't answer fall back to single calls; while bulk is off, ``enabled()`` says
so and the caller skips the batcher altogether.

*gate* is an async context manager factory entered around every outbound
request — the process's MDBList concurrency semaphore and pacing — so a title
waiting in a batch holds neither.
